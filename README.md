Coding Challenges


**Challenge 1**: Given a number say 82, determine if that number is even or odd



**Challenge 2**: Find minimum value in the following array [3,54,22,76,33,7,34,2,34,67,73,44]



**Challenge 3**: We want to generate two random numbers and make sure they are equal. If the two are not equal then we try again and contunue to generate two new random numbers until we can general equal random numbers



**Challenge 4**: Find if string is a palindrome: https://examples.yourdictionary.com/palindrome-examples.html



**Challenge 5**: Find the first repeating number in an array: [4,32,56,44,87,6,32,81,44,7]



**Challenge 6**: Print fibonacci: https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html 



**Challenge 7**: Write a program to determine whether a given number is prime or not



**Challenge 8**: Write a program to display the number 4752 in reverse order



**Challenge 9**: Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old



**Challenge 10**: Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user



**Challenge 11**: Take a list, say for example this one:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 10



**Challenge 12**: Take two lists, say for example these two:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes



**Challenge 13**: Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write a program that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it



**Challenge 14**: Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. For practice, write this code inside a function



**Challenge 15**: Write a program (function!) that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates



**Challenge 16**: Write a password generator in Swift. Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password



**Challenge 17**: Write a function that takes an ordered list of numbers (a list where the elements are in order from smallest to largest) and another number. The function decides whether or not the given number is inside the list and returns (then prints) an appropriate boolean. Use Binary search: google it and then redo in Swift



**Challenge 18**: Implement a function that takes as input three variables, and returns the largest of the three



**Challenge 19**: Create a dictionary (in your file) of names and birthdays. When you run your program it should ask the user to enter a name, and return the birthday of that person back to them. The interaction should look something like this:

>>> Welcome to the birthday dictionary. We know the birthdays of:
Albert Einstein
Benjamin Franklin
Ada Lovelace
>>> Who's birthday do you want to look up?
Benjamin Franklin
>>> Benjamin Franklin's birthday is 01/17/1706



**Challenge 20**:
